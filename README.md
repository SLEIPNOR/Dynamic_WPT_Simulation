# WPT_Simulation
# How to run this code:
(1) Run Raspi with hardware mode firstly (Trun on the Raspi)  
(2) Run TxArray  
(3) Observe the result in scope  
(4) Sampling time of both TxArray and Raspi are essential elements in sumulation (fixed-step size)    
(5) All code are servicing for thr simulation blocks  
(6) Raspi_2layer and TxArray_2layer files are used for 8 layers Tx array system
